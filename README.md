# Fruit-Purchase-Tracker
This PHP web application allows users to track the purchase of different fruits (apples, pears, and bananas) by storing the quantities in a session. Users can increment the count of each fruit or reset it to zero using the provided buttons. Additionally, there is an option to destroy the session, resetting all fruit counts to their initial values.
